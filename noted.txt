We use JavaScript to modify web page.
Syntax: - rule that we have to follow when using a programming language.

=> first step: we learn about
				1. JavaScript is giving instructions to a computer 
				2. Write JavaScript code
				3. Run our code using the Console
				4. Syntax
Lesson 2: Number and Math
=> Second step: we learn about 
				1. Number and Math
				2. Order of Operators, and Brackets (...)
				3. Calculated the numbers in final project
				4. Calculations using floats can be inccurate 

=> Interpolation = insert value directly into a string.
=> What should we use to create a string?
   1. Use '...' by default
   2. If we need interpolation, multi-line strings use `...`
 => third step : 
		1. String = text
		2. Use strings and numbers together
		3. three ways to create strings: '...'  "..."  `...`(template string)
		4. Escape characters: \` \n
		5. Interpolation. multi-line strings

=> Lesson 4: HTML CSS Review. console.log
	1. HTML = create the content
	2. CSS = change the appearance
	3. JavaScript = makes it interactive
Setup
   Install a code editor(help us write and organize code)
- HTML Hyper = Text Markup Language and also giving the construction to a computer.

	Web page = a single page (on a website) like the home page or cart page and together call a website.

	=> What is a variable ?
	variable = a container -> we can save a value and then use it later.

	Note: variable name restriction:
	1. Can't use special words Example : lat
	2. Can't start with a number
	3. Can't use specail characters except:$_

	Don't use let when reassign the value.


===============================================
|(*_*)	Variable Re-assignment Shortcuts (*_*)|
-----------------------------------------------
	+= 2	variable = variable +			
	-= 2	variable = variable -2
	*= 2	variable = variable *2
	/= 2	variable = variable /2
	++		variable = variable +2
	--		variable = variable -2
===============================================


Naming Convention that use in programing
- camelCase: capitalize every word axcept the first word. Example(cartQuantity)
- PascalCase: Example(CartQuantity)
-Kebab-case: Example(cart-quantity) -> does't work in JavaScript. use in HTML and CSS and file name.
-snake-case: Example(cart_quantity)


main idea of JavaScript 
1. Save the data
2. Generate it interactive
3. Make it interactive
